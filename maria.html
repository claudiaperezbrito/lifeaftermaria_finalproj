    <p>On September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico over the southeastern city of Yabucoa as a category 4 hurricane. It continued its course traveling over the central mountainous region of the island. Hurricane Maria left thousands without power and a home. A year later, Puerto Ricans in some regions still struggle with access to electricity or have not found means to repair their homes.

    <p>A year after Hurricane Maria many Puerto Ricans still struggled to pick up all the pieces in their lives in hopes to return to normalcy. Some spent almost a year without electricity, some continue living with blue tarps as roofs, and some lost absolutely everything. For Puerto Ricans that experienced the hurricane first-hand there will always be a "before" and "after" Hurricane Maria. </p>

She purchases dog food or receives donation from locals in order to continue feeding them. Photos by <a href="https://www.kaitlinhallphotography.com/" target="_blank">Kaitlin Hall</a>.</p>
